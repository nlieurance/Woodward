# Overview
As a new technical writer for Woodward, my first 90 days will be about building a mental model of systems and workflows. From there, I’ll be able to develop solutions to the most important challenges. Here’s how...

## Top three priorities
By focusing on three key themes, I’ll make measurable progress in reasonable time.

1. Establish relationships with key stakeholders.
  - Interview and shadow machine operators.
  - Talk with engineers about how they work.
  - Speak with trainer(s) and technical writers about documentation.
2. Understand processes and tools used.
  - Explore models in Creo.
  - Examine existing work instructions in Ignition.
  - Sketch out models of workflows and systems.
3. Work with stakeholders to brainstorm solutions to big challenges.
  - How might we keep work instruction content up to date?
  - How might we prevent operators from missing work-instruction changes?

## Measuring & communicating progress

### Milestones
As I work on the above priorities, I’ll make progress towards several artifacts and insights:
- User personas to understand user needs at a glance
- Journey maps with jobs-to-be-done, pain points, and opportunities
- Process map that shows how Woodward goes from design to finished part, who is involved during each step, and what the handoff from the technical writer to the shop floor looks like 

### Reporting
I’ll report on progress toward each milestone on a weekly basis.
